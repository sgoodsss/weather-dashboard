# Weather-Dashboard
Retrieves weather data from cities via Server-Side APIs

## Description
My motivation for building this app was to practice pulling data from Server Side APIs and dynamically changing my HTML page with that data.  Using the API Open Weather, I was able to pull data for cities and update my website with them!  My weather app keeps users informed of the weather by providing them with information in any city that they search.  I learned how to navigate through data fetched by Server Side APIs and further enhanced my knowledge of JavaScript through this assignment.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To begin, type a city name in the search box and click the search button.  The current weather forecast and a 5 day weather forecast will load to the page.  Each section includes the date, an icon displaying the current weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, and humiditiy levels.  On the left side the of page, grey buttons will appear with previous city searches.  When clicked, the page will reload to display the weather of that city.
